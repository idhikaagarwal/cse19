        <h1 style="color:red";>GLOBAL WARMING</h1>
        <p>Present-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth's climate system.
             Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous
             long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel (coal, oil and natural gas) 
             burning since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil
              fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases.These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after
               it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the
                pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.</p>

        <p>Climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.Amplified warming in 
            the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, 
          retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline.Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.Rapid environmental change in mountains,
           coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species 
        to relocate or become extinct.Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification 
        and sea level rise.</p>

        <p>Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss.Human migration and conflict can also be a result.The World Health Organization calls
        climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century.Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming.Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood 
       control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached.Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability 
        to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.</p>

        Examples of some effects of climate change: Wildfire intensified by heat and drought, bleaching of corals occurring more often due to marine heatwaves, and worsening droughts compromising water supplies.
       Many climate change impacts have been observed in the first decades of the 21st century, with 2024 the warmest on record at +1.60 °C (2.88 °F) since regular tracking began in 1850.Additional warming 
       will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as melting all of the Greenland ice sheet.Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming "well under 2 °C".
       However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.8 °C (5.0 °F) by the end of the century.</p>
